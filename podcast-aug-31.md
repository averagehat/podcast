### Why Mike hates this episode

 <summary> Reasons </summary>
So he takes an episode of veep that got rejected because there wasn’t enough “hustle” / “rushed walking.” Changes the character’s names, Realizes he has the wrong main character and says, “Oh, old people take drugs, lets put him on drugs with goofy side-effects”
sends it off to Adam McKay, who said yes, but it’s not edgy enough can you add a twenty minute humiliation scene?
And Veep writer sighs and says, sure, I’ve got 60 minutes and nothing to say anyhow.

I don’t really like Logan going after Pierce, I guess it kind of fits his character, 
What’s different at the end of the episode that’s different from the start?
- most of it happens in the first five minutes, meaning the action of the show is irrelevant
- now we have another episode about pierce

this might be an okay episode of whatever grey gardens / parks and rec frankenstein this smoked-out 

Horace Walpole said, The world is a comedy to those that think; a tragedy to those that feel. And I think it’s a tragedy that this episode of the comedic show succession sucks my dirty grimy balls.

everyone just says what they mean
This whole, yuk-yuk, whatever you say boss! bullshit is played out

There were people writing about the show when it came out who said, “this show doesn’t know what it’s doing. It’s halfway into comedy, it’s halfway into drama, and it can’t find its center.” And they were right. This season has really proved it. I think it was less jarring in episode one because we had that long break. But now after episode 2, which was a really great episode, this is really jarring. 

Bad writing: the arc of this episode isn’t character, and it isn’t plot. It’s not character, because Logan’s behavior is caused by medication, which you need because what he does is inconsistent with his craftiness and aloofness. And it’s not plot, because we have no idea if he’s going to be on the medication in the future or not! So who the fuck cares?

the banker guy exists to say ominous businessy shit to scare liberals into joining the DSA?

Veep is great but I don’t learn anything from watching it except how smart the writers are.

Every character in this episode drops 40 IQ points (except greg who was already kind of _there_, in that he’s clueless. He’s the one person who it fits)

It really seems like they have, like, six episodes worth of material, and they’re filling it out. And they kind of did that in the first season, but the finale was so good we kind of let it go.	

And it’s gonna take a show, that could have been one of the best shows on premium TV, or whatever, and bomb it.

Here’s the thing: everyone’s just doing what they were already doing. What you know they were going to do,

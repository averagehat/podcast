### Why Mike hates this episode
<details>
 <summary> Reasons </summary>
So he takes an episode of veep that got rejected because there wasn’t enough “hustle” / “rushed walking.” Changes the character’s names, Realizes he has the wrong main character and says, “Oh, old people take drugs, lets put him on drugs with goofy side-effects”
sends it off to Adam McKay, who said yes, but it’s not edgy enough can you add a twenty minute humiliation scene?
And Veep writer sighs and says, sure, I’ve got 60 minutes and nothing to say anyhow.

I don’t really like Logan going after Pierce, I guess it kind of fits his character, 
What’s different at the end of the episode that’s different from the start?
- most of it happens in the first five minutes, meaning the action of the show is irrelevant
- now we have another episode about pierce

this might be an okay episode of whatever grey gardens / parks and rec frankenstein this smoked-out 

Horace Walpole said, The world is a comedy to those that think; a tragedy to those that feel. And I think it’s a tragedy that this episode of the comedic show succession sucks my dirty grimy balls.

everyone just says what they mean
This whole, yuk-yuk, whatever you say boss! bullshit is played out

There were people writing about the show when it came out who said, “this show doesn’t know what it’s doing. It’s halfway into comedy, it’s halfway into drama, and it can’t find its center.” And they were right. This season has really proved it. I think it was less jarring in episode one because we had that long break. But now after episode 2, which was a really great episode, this is really jarring. 

Bad writing: the arc of this episode isn’t character, and it isn’t plot. It’s not character, because Logan’s behavior is caused by medication, which you need because what he does is inconsistent with his craftiness and aloofness. And it’s not plot, because we have no idea if he’s going to be on the medication in the future or not! So who the fuck cares?

the banker guy exists to say ominous businessy shit to scare liberals into joining the DSA?

Veep is great but I don’t learn anything from watching it except how smart the writers are.

Every character in this episode drops 40 IQ points (except greg who was already kind of _there_, in that he’s clueless. He’s the one person who it fits)

It really seems like they have, like, six episodes worth of material, and they’re filling it out. And they kind of did that in the first season, but the finale was so good we kind of let it go.	

And it’s gonna take a show, that could have been one of the best shows on premium TV, or whatever, and bomb it.

Here’s the thing: everyone’s just doing what they were already doing. What you know they were going to do,

### Old Greg
<details>
<summary> Greg talking to the writer </summary>
Because actually meeting you would be a big step.  - Uh-huh. -
I'm a time-pressed executive, so before we even get to the ethical considerations, can I eke out time in my calendar? Of course.

Um On the other hand, I don't think it's too self-aggrandizing to hope I might have some wisdom to impart.  
....  
Okay, I need to think.  I need I'm gonna go, I I'm But this leaving How I look, and how I'm getting up and everything, is off the record, okay?
</details>
Greg is worried this whole episode  
Typical Greg!  
Tom doesn't rat him out. 

### Logan

Logan doesn't go see "Mo", who doesn't exist outside this ep. His doctor warns him abt the drugs.  
This episode seems to be about how Logan is a bad person and that's bad?  Oh, Logan, he's so arrogant and forceful and cruel! Oh my!  

His banker buddy exists to say ominous businessy shit to scare liberals into joining the DSA. The show is beating a dead horse.

A number of things land flat:
- The pastries break
- boar on the floor

### Logan and Pierce
In the pastry room:  
Karl is suddenly a fucking moron.  Also so is Gerri? Got goofy in there all of a sudden
Kendall is playing spy, that's fun. Roman will lose    
"most pointy-headed fuck" Well, it's a shame Uh, but you did have one heavyweight that they liked. "Bore Vidal" "Old shakespeare frank"  

### Roman and Tabs
I like the way "ROMAN: Hey, is anyone in my house? "  
Roman's move on Naomi doesn't really play as significant at all, I guess he went against his dad's orderst to keep it under wraps   
<details>
<summary> Cameron's video </summary>

I ranch, I ride, I earn, and I give.  Just like you.  But ding-dong, who's there? Uncle Sam.  And where's his hand? In my pants.  

ROMAN: Hey, is anyone in my house? Hey.  

Uh, have you seen this? Yeah.  

He said he's beta testing it, before he Instagrams and enters the "ideas primary".  

Maybe he's a genius.  
</details>

### Shiv and Tom
Shiv is suddenly anti-monopoly? And so is Gerri? And Shiv is craftlessly brutal

<details> <summary> their dialogue </summary>
It's a 20-billion-dollar acquisition that either breaks us or takes half a decade to integrate.  We need to stop him.  So, talk to him in Hungary.   <br> 
- What? - Yeah.  

I I don't think I wanna do that, Shiv.  

Uh Oh, hello? Is this the replicant department? Yeah, my meat-puppet has stopped working.   

Shiv.  Shiv.  

Tom, I'm joking.  But I'm also not.  People would do well to remember there's gonna be a new sheriff in town one day.  So, rally the resistance, Deputy.  </details>
Oh god that last line was so bad

### Willa and Connor
What will happen with the "fucking pieces of shit" connor hired?  
The writers had a chance to "show Willa" here, and they didn't do antyhing with it. Instead Shiv has sex with a boring person  
Shiv with the random actor—the guys women have one-night-stands with on TV are always like this   
<details> <summary> really great dialogue and character development </summary>
Uh, I gotta make a call.  

Jealous boyfriend?   

No.  Just a guy who works for me.  

- Working on a Saturday?  

- He better be.  

Wow, sounds like you're riding him hard.  

Well, maybe he likes it.  

Are you flirting with me? Your flirt got all over my pants.  I'll be right back.  Hey, Tom.  Just checking you talked to him.  Don't let me down, soldier.
</dialogue>
### The Retreat 
Nothing happens until boar-on-the-floor. Roman and Kendall have a cute talk.   
Gerri and Karl try to get Tom to talk to Logan. This is so fucking stupid. Why would they even think that would work? Why did everyone get dumb like mormon level dumb?  
So Tom does talk to him about it, but it doesn't count, somehow?  
His banker buddy exists to say ominous businessy shit to scare liberals into joining the DSA. The show is beating a dead horse.
"That's about as choreographed as a dog getting fucked on roller-skates."  
Logan becomes less interesting to me as he loses status as "genius villain" and calls Karl a whoremongerer  
"Tom, did your fragile talk to Pantsil?"  
Kendall steals Roman's phone. Kind of weird

### Boar on the floor
God that was a waste of fifteen minutes
### Some other bullshit
Hey check out this B-line isn't that just saucy  

- "So, uh, no TV? You a You a laptop guy? Nah, no screens.  
- No, uh No news? 
- Oh, I don't follow the news. No, these days, actually the real news - comes from comedians.  
- (CHUCKLES) Oh.  Wow. I'm not crazy to hear the next thing you're gonna say.
- Can I just kiss you?

### Aftermath

Oh hey nothing happened in this episode so next episode it's still gonna be about Pierce lul

"You know, if I were capable of any sudden movement, I would totally pounce on you right now."

Also, nothing happened in these relationships so let's have a wrap-up for each that makes it sound like something changed:
<details> <summary> dialogue </summary> 
Maybe it wasn't totally great what you sent me to do.  Which is kind of the opposite of what I wanted to do.  
Uh-huh.  
Yeah.<Paste>  
I mean - we're a team, right? - Yeah.  But I I don't wanna be a dick, but maybe I should have a bit more input into team tactics.  
Yeah.  
Sure.  Of course.  
Thanks.  
So, how was your weekend?   
- SHIV: Me? - Yeah.  
Anything to report? Uh Yeah.  
Okay.  
Do you want to know?  
Oh.  I don't know, maybe later.  
Come here.  
(BOTH KISSING) (PHONE VIBRATING) Hey, Dad.  
LOGAN: Hello, Pinkie.  
Sorry I missed your call.  
Had a lot to deal with.  
Termites in the woodwork.  
Insurgents.  
Oh, yeah? Coming from where? Oh, front row, cheap seats, every-fucking-where.  
SHIV: Not from me.  
What are you doing at the moment? - I'm free.  
- LOGAN: We'll set a date.  It's time to bring you in.

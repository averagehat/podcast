### Opening
Opening: back at the theme park  
kendall is a broken robot
Logan follows Shiv’s advice

### Tom & Shiv
[shiv and tom: “maybe it’s fine to fuck the odd peasant”]


### Roman, Ken & Lawrence Yee
Yee loves to shit on Ken  
Roman is kind of crafty about Vaulter by being Hot-and-cold and always on the offensive. Kind of how his dad is with Shiv later.  

“I heard you were drying out in a Schloss, doing shitty yoga with hausfrau?”  

“Pedo on parole”

 “his giant cyclops eye is looking in this direction, and he's feeling like maybe he bought a giant pile of bullshit. So now here I am to enquire in the politest terms possible what the fuck is going on.”

“Dude, really, don't take it personally.  Dad thinks everyone's fucking him."

### Greg and Tom: Punching and Principles
Justin will disagree but Tom has a real point here. This is like the scene where Nate explains "inequality" are his reasons for supporting Gil, and Shiv laughs at him. Again we have a one-word answer, "racism" "dishonesty."

  <summary>Dialogue</summary>

**T:**  It's Logan's G-spot.  I can finger-bang him all night long.  I'm a direct direct report.  What? 

**G:**  Sure, just ATN? It's It's like - kind of against my principles.  

**T:**  Your principles? Greg, don't be an asshole. You don't have principles.

**G:**  Dude, ATN is a very toxic element in the culture.

**T:**  Oh, seriously? Okay, name me one principle that you have.

**G:**  I don't know, like, I'm against racism.

**T:**  Bullshit.  I'm against racism.  Everybody's against racism.  What else?

**G:**  Like, don't lie.  

**T:**  Fuck off.  

**G:**  Like, if you're the news, you--

**T:**  Fuck off!   That's your principle?   

**G:** Yeah, dude.  

**T:**  Greg, this is not fucking Charles Dickens world, okay? You don't go around talking about principles.  We're all trying to do the right thing, of course we are.  But come on, man! Man the fuck up!  

**G:** (MUTTERING) Okay, I am manned, man.

  <summary> Season 1 ep 10 shiv and Nate </summary>
  What was that text message you sent before? Some kind of anti-proposal? "I won't do it if you won't"?
  
  Look, I just spoke to Gil, and it sounds like, well, he thought he was being very subtle and all, but something has happened, and I wondered what the fuck that was.

Happened with what? 

In terms of burying whatever it is we know and not being afraid of ATN anymore.

Oh.  Well, that's an interesting perspective.

I brought you in.

What did I do? I'm gonna make him win.

He's gonna win anyway.

I might not agree.

Well, yeah, look, I don't want to play the bleeding heart here, but there is a reason I work with him, and it's because of inequality, and--

Oh! Inequality! Well, if you can't handle it, then fuck off.

Who are you? 

I'm Shiv fucking Roy.  And I'm gonna have two very grateful people the next president and my father.

</details>

### Nate and Shiv and Gil: The Carrot
Shiv is fucking Nate over. Is she cocky? self-destructive? I start to wonder, what happened before she met Tom?
jjj
<details>

<summary> Shiv and Nate dialogue </summary>
So did he actually even see my draft? Uh no.
In the end, I just thought the draft Kelly and I did had more, uh, goodness.
As in ? As in it had the quality of being good rather than the attributes of being shitty.
NATE: Um, just also re Kelly, little sidebar.
Can you not tell people about us? Oh, but there is no us.
Right.
but there was an us, and the problem is, my wife doesn't know about it.
Oh, but my husband absolutely does know about it, so I guess that's, what, it's your problem? We had the affair.
We didn't have the conversation about telling people we had the affair.
I'm sorry, Nate, did you want a conference call to discuss how to tell your wife we fucked? - (APPLAUSE) - 
</details>

<details>
 <summary> Shiv and gil Dialogue </summary>
 Great.
They're eating out of my ass crack.
Offered me use of the fucking jet on the weekend.
Uh, yeah, I mean, the legals are wonky and the optics are shitty, but (CHUCKLES) go ahead.
Look.
You don't look a gift Boeing in the teeth.
Right? Right? - No.
- I'll be so much fresher.
Excuse us for a second.
I just wanna Ma'am, listen.
Long road to travel and all of that, but the compass points to Pennsylvania Avenue.
I have to start thinking about appointments.
I'm thinking about Chief of Staff.
Uh Oh, wow.
- Yeah.
- (CHUCKLES) I mean, can you imagine the look of fear in their eyes when they see you coming at them? Those corpulent old white fucks.
- (CHUCKLES) - Huh? How's that for a carrot? Hm?

</details>


The dialogue in this five minutes, from Gil to Tom's extraneious Danish is fucking top-notch

### Tom and the giant peach (Cyd)
Peach owns Tom, Tom asks Greg to "body shame ATN"  
Tom looks clueless. Interesting defense of Fox News. 

<details> <summary> dialogue </summary>

So that's where we shape the debate.

Ooh, cool shit.  And I love the way the debate keeps on getting shaped like a burning cross.  (LAUGHS) 

You don't share our news values.  

Oh, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I get it.  I'm from the Midwest.  You know, my mom's friend, Deb, weighs, like, 300 pounds, and she's pissed as fuck about practically everything, so, you know, trust me, I'm down.
I get it.  Besides, what Logan wants, Logan gets, right? 

Logan doesn't set our news agenda.  

Oh.  (LAUGHS) No, of course he doesn't.  I know, it's so weird, huh? He happens to own a news company and they say exactly what he thinks. 

If Logan had to tell me or any of my news editors what to run or what the angle was, we would be fucked.  That is not how it works.  This isn't mind control.  We hire people who want to work here.  and we serve a demographic of highly, highly intelligent viewers, who are really tired of being patronized elsewhere by latte-sipping douchebags with hundred-dollar haircuts.  You've got the cool job title, you've got freedom of movement.  Why don't you take a look somewhere more comfy? Entertainment?

    
    <br>


 Like, find the excess, okay? Find the extraneous Danish, the surfeit of stationary, the the lazy cleaner, the mail guy who walks slow.
Okay? Snuffle out waste, pig man.
Okay, I'll do the penthouse, you do the basement.

</details>


### Shiv and Logan
Logan gets Marcia to leave. Why hide this from her? Marcia knows something's up; Logan says something about spies. Is that a cut at her?  
Logan does excellent conversational manuevering here. His strategy is: make demands he knows she won't agree to, then use her non-compliance against her. So he sets her into a position to be blamed if anything goes wrong. It's also classic negating/criticizing. He's also feigning ignorance/innocence; "I'm fucking confused" and surprise about the timeline.  
There is an economy of blame here, and gusto. The blame is the classic back and forth of daily conversational positioning and status; like a discussion with your partner about taking out the trash, or how your boss keeps screwing you over.  Social status is assembled out of innocence, and brining down others (we also do this internally to satisfy our egos).  
There's also the economy of gusto: a kind of big-dick contest along the lines of: are you really into this? Becuase I'm into this. Which is, of course, a feint, because while his children are so invested, Logan doesn't really give a shit.   

<details> <summary> dialogue </summary>
(To Marcia): Can you check if Richard's turned off that fuckin' Alexa? Not just off, unplugged.  I've got enough spies after me without Bezos in here too.  Okay?   
Right.  
(FOOTSTEPS MOVING AWAY) LOGAN: So here's how I see it.  
Come in.  
Six months with Gerri, six months with Karl.  
Hong Kong for, say, another 12.  
Uh, Berlin, or London.  
Management training program for six.  
Come back, spend 12 months alongside me.  
And when you're ready, I'll step aside.  
Wow, Dad, that's a lot of months.  
It's an appropriate amount of months.  
Also, management training program? Roman's COO.  
You have a toddler with a hard-on for chief operating officer, and I'm going through a management training program? You're a young woman with no experience.  
A woman.  
That's a minus.  
Well, of course it's a fucking minus! I didn't make the world!  
SHIV: You make a small part of it.  
If that doesn't work for you, what does? 
That's a fucking That's a three-year timeline.   
Okay.  So why don't you come in tomorrow and spend the day with me? 
Oh, Jesus Christ, Dad.  
What?  
I need time, I I haven't even told Tom yet.  
- Tell him.  
- And there's Gil.  I have a job, I can't just come running to you.  
What is it, Siobhan, too slow or too fast? Because I'm fucking confused.  
Dad, I want this.  It's just about the process.  
Okay.  
SHIV: Okay? So you wanna get into it?  
Not now.  I'm busy.  Proxy statement.  You didn't give me any warning.  
- All right.  
- I mean, you know, tomorrow night could work? -
- Tomorrow? Uh (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Yeah, let me take a look.  
Oh, is that no good for you? 
I'm around.  - I'm excited.  
Mm-hmm.  Me too.   
I'll get back to you tomorrow - on the names for the board.  
- Mm-hmm.  
- Love you.  
- I love you.  
Goodnight.  
All right.

### Kendall at Vaulter
Roman does a good job in the room with his Dad and Kendall; he's convincing, knows the buttons, and got the info. 
<details>
 <summary> decision room on vaulter with logan gerri roman and ken dialogue </summary>
KEN: Uh, ethos and culture are leading edge.
And, um, in my view, it's fixable.
It's funny how these fuck-ups always make the bottom line look fatter.
All they need is adults in the room.
Accounting team, analytics team, and, uh, investment.
We burn 50 million for a few years, we make it the best thing in the world.
Oh, is that all? Well, you always say "Gotta burn to turn."

LOGAN: Romulus, what's your read? 

You know, it's interesting, Dad, because I hear everything that he's saying, and it actually It almost sounds like a good pitch.  But I call bullshit.  I spent some time down there, and I'm just not seeing it.  Now, I don't know exactly what they're doing, but they're fakes.  Fucking beehives, almond milk, and "Take another week on that report, Matilda." It smells wrong, and they're hiding shit.  Speaking of hiding shit, I took a couple of their staffers out, I got them shitfaced, and apparently, they're looking to unionize, and fucking soon.

Logan: Oh, yeah? 

ROMAN: Pay transparency, bargaining rights.
Just nasty, tangly shit.  And it's not a body pit, whatever the fuck a body pit is.  It's a fucking muesli pit, and doesn't fit with our core, you know values.  So now I'm thinking we just shutter the fucker.

Close it? That's chunky.

Come I mean He doesn't know what he's talking about.  That's just insane.
Gerri: The write-down on that would be what? It's a bitter pill.

Come on, I mean, i i in the middle of a proxy fight when we've got Stewy and Sandy taking out full-page ads in the Journal attacking us for pissing capital up the wall? It It I mean, it makes us look weak.

No, it makes us look ruthless.  
And actually, I do know what I'm fucking talking about.
Dad, what the fuck are we doing? Show me the bloat anywhere else in this company.
Where is it? You show me.
Show me the waste that we're letting these fuckers get away with.
Fine, so we restructure them and we grow them ROMAN: I think if we don't shutter it, then we gut it.
We carve that shit like a pumpkin.
</details>

Kendall throwing paper towel at his mirror image  

### Connor's party
Willa seems so unhappy  😞
Roman is cute and nervous: 

- Uh sorry, what? Do you Roman Roy, did you just invite us to dinner? 

- Oh, fuck you.  All right, shut up.  Yes, I did.  Metro poser bullshit.  (HIGH VOICE) Napkins and chitchat.  Ooh, race relations.  Kale.


Shiv checking up on Ken about Vaulter, interesting.  " You have a hard time finding a happy medium between worshipping him and wanting to kill him."

Roman's crisis about Vaulter: says something "about work." Tabitha says it beautiully
<details> <summary> Roman and Tabs </summary>
R: The Vaulter thing.  
TABITHA: Mm.  
Gutting it.  
R: What if it's the wrong thing? I thought your dad agreed with you? Uh, yeah, he did.  And now they're doing it.  They're actually doing the thing that I said.  
TABITHA: Fuck.  Think maybe you just did your job.  Shall we get some more champagne?   
R: I mean It could be right.  It might not be, but it could be.  
R: Maybe I'm smart.  
T: Sure.  Maybe.  You did a thing.  Mazel tov.  

</details>

### Roman Justin's Doc
- continued indecision over his abilities
- We see genuine intelligence in his reconaissance at vaulter - soft skills after laziness
- However, indecisive about his argument to shutter vaulter
- Also scared of shiv and tom’s ascendance, has dinner to suss this out
- Despite logan going with his advice, kendall in the office at the end
- **Where do we see Roman going as a character?**

### Shiv tells Tom that she's next in line
emasculated Tom and sex drive reversal   
tom looks so pathetic here  
I mean it's hilarious, right??  

<details> <summary> Justin's doc </summary>

Shiv and Tom Relationship

Shiv finally reveals truth about the position to Tom

Macfadden does a great job acting someone clearly dismayed who is hiding it

Enjoy the two conversations and how the libido changes

Why Tom wants to have sex in the morning but not evening is obvious, but why does shiv change in the reverse?  What does this tell us about her character?

Tom takes over at fox news and basically just wants to cut costs in the short term to make a name for himself

Fox news lady cyd peach, latte liberals

Go to dinner with Roman/Shiv and Tom snaps at Shiv as they continue to treat him like a peasant/2nd class/garbage “look like a divorce attorney from the twin cities”

**Clearly there is tension on Tom’s side that is bubbling up.  Where do we see this relationship going?**
</details>
### Ken at vaulter
Bitch Kendall does not care what vaulter employees think  
Bitch Kendall  doesn’t posture: speaking to vaulter about Union

<details>
<summary> dialogue bits </summary>

YEE: I hear your brother's running for president.  Maybe we should get him here.  He seems like the the serious one.

</details>

<details> <summary> Justin's doc </summary>

Investigate vaulter, then strip it for parts despite Kendall’s reluctance

Was genuinely surprised by Ken’s deception, thought he might be playing his dad (though really I shouldn’t have been)

It was great, continues to be dead eyed, subservient, addicted, but badass like when he gets spit on, enjoyed his comeuppance calling lawrence a cunt (Go find another chicken coop, cunt), him saying “I can take it”

Genuinely enjoyed watching a bunch of people get fired

Logan both enjoys making Ken gut Vaulter and is proud of the work that he does, rewards him despite it being Roman’s idea

Like how kendall looks out window, reacts - frozen, happy

</details> 

### Ken gives Greg an apartment
Ken is changing. But no gift is without a cost, the party

### Dinner Party and tom and Shiv
Tom is the punching bag here. It's the human-centipde caste order: Roman's above tom, who's above greg  
Also, Shiv kind of sets this up by laughing off Tom as harmless. This is a kind of co-creation of who other people are.  

The looks that Roman and Shiv give. Is ATN analog for a reason?  

Later with Tom, Shiv says she's going to lead from the back. But she can't stick to this. She's too eager, or something. 

<details> <summary> dialogue </summary>
OUTSIDE:  
Shiv, should I be worried about Tom? (SHIV LAUGHING) Tom? No, you don't need to be worried about Tom.
Okay.
All right.

INSIDE:  
How's news, Tom? Challenging.
Tough row to hoe, but, you know think I see a way out.
- It's good, yeah.
- ROMAN: Yeah? A way out.
Good for you, man.
So what is it, this way out? Oh, it's early days, and I Yeah.
I haven't even discussed it with Logan yet, but Oh, so it's a secret? That's fucking exciting.
When are you gonna tell him, at the sleepover? Well, um, no.
We're-looking in Well, I'm looking into digitizing ATN.
Like, a total overhaul of the of the legacy analog infrastructure.
Yeah.
Making a lot of productivity gains as well, so I think your dad will be pretty pleased.
Fuckin' A.
Look at the corn-feeder.
Going all synergies and shit.
- Yeah.
- ROMAN: Nice.
Worth a shot.
Thanks, man.
Where do you buy your suits, by the way, Tom? Like, maybe that's why I'm just not moving as fast as you.
I just don't have that, like, boxy, corporate look.
Right? I mean, I'm sorry, but, like, what the fuck? You look like a Transformer.
Like, wh what's wrong with your body, man? Rome, come on.
There's nothing wrong with his body, it's just fuckin' suits.
What? Come on, we we've laughed about it before.
- ROMAN: You have? - Yeah.
He's thrifty, and he has the worst taste in suits.
Totally has terrible Ta You look like a divorce attorney from the Twin Cities.
It's partly the walk.
It's like a real - ROMAN: Robot? - No, agricultural walk.
(ROMAN AND TABITHA LAUGH) Agricultural walk! You know, I tried to get, uh, one of his suits tailored - by the guy that Dad uses.
- ROMAN: Mm-hmm.
- But he just looked so, like - Hey, Shiv? Fuck off.

<br>

So, I'm probably just gonna sleep in the guest room so I don't keep you awake.

SHIV: Uh, are you kidding me? 

TOM: What? We'll both sleep better.

SHIV: Tom.
Come on.
We've just We've gotten tangled up, okay? Honey, you're the only one I can talk to about this stuff.
I need you.

- Now, I have a choice - TOM: Mm-hmm.
to make.
It's either Gil, or it's Dad.
And it's a bit of a headfuck.

### Kendall guts Vaulter

guy spits on him: is that all you've got?  

 Yeah, sorry about the, uh, cloak and dagger.  I just needed some time to untangle all your shit, find the profit centers, keep the union off our back.  We're already fully operational on seven.
- Why? - Because my dad told me to.

LAWRENCE: Because your dad told you to? Jesus Christ.  Because your dad told you to? You You fucked it, bro.  Uh-huh.

Go find some other chicken coop, cunt.

And the aftermath: 
- Kendall high as balls at his party. 
<details>  <summary> dialogue </summary>

No, dude, exactly.
Listen, Ken, I was, uh, super wiped and I My legs are just killing me.
And my lower back.
So do you think you could maybe bring the party up to yours? - Up to mine? - Up to your place.
Yeah, I don't think so, Greg.
You know, I'm just, like I'm looking for pussy like a fuckin' techno Gatsby.
Hell yeah! That's Hell yeah, man.
Um There's also some of your acquaintances are maybe humping in my bedroom? If you c Or Can talk to them
I need to test the hamstrings But no paps.
I don't need another shot of me looking like a used dick.

</details>



### Shiv breaks off with Gil
Shiv created this by fucking over Gil re:his wife, theh speech  
Earlier with Tom, Shiv says she's going to lead from the back. But she can't stick to this. She's too eager, or something. 
Obviously this is self-destructive. Is it because she can't be honest with herself about what she wants, so she sabotages the othe roption?

<details> <summary> Justin's doc </summary>
Tom’s advice seems legitimately smart - keep one foot in both places because logan could easily fuck you over (of course, it’s also the one piece of advice that most benefits him).  Also, chief of staff is arguably a more powerful job.
**However, she doesn’t go with it, and needlessly venomously snaps at gil over the hand washing comment Why did she do this, needlessly sabotage her relationship with gil?**
**Was this her plan, or a genuine fuckup?  And if it was planned, why did she do it?  Specifically to just reject tom’s advice?  Out of anger at nate, who she is needleslly fucking over with the cheating?  Makes no sense.  Thrill of fighting against father no longer there?**

**What do we think the consequences of her decision to fuck over / burn a bridge with bernie sanders will be?

For her? For bernie sanders?  For nate?  For way star royco?**

Shiv advises her Dad, wins out 

They talk at his penthouse, tells marcia to go away

100% sure with his 3.5 year plan that he is fucking with her
</summary>
### Kendall's aftermath

- Logan makes Kendall his #1, Roman hates it
- Kendall steals batteries and throws them away 

from the after-show commentary: 
- It's interesting to me that he's been through a tragedy, he's in this submissive relationship with his dad, but maybe there's some freedoms you get with being submissive, too.  And that you can do some tough stuff if you feel like you're not responsible anymore.

Is his new freedom a new resilience, or the lull of irresponsibility?

**How do you think Ken’s addiction will continue to play out?**

**Lawrence: - Is fucking him over a problem?  Will he align with Stewy and Sandy now?** 

**Why does Kendall steal the batteries?  What does this reveal about his character?  Something about relationship with Logan?  A reaction to not having power / control?**
